# Chapter 7: Interacting with Devices

In this chapter, we will explore how the operating system can communicate with hardware devices. We will focus on two essential devices: the keyboard and the serial port. We will also create a more sophisticated console driver.

## 7.1. Keyboard Driver

We have already seen a very basic keyboard handler in the chapter on interrupts. Now, we will expand it into a proper keyboard driver. This will involve:

*   **Handling key presses and releases:** We will need to keep track of the state of each key.
*   **Mapping scan codes to ASCII characters:** We will create a keymap that translates the raw scan codes from the keyboard into the corresponding ASCII characters.
*   **Buffering input:** We will create a keyboard buffer to store key presses until a program is ready to read them.

## 7.2. Serial Communication

The serial port is a simple and effective way to communicate with the host machine, especially for debugging purposes. We will write a driver for the serial port that will allow us to send and receive data. This will be very useful for printing debugging messages from our kernel without cluttering the main console.

## 7.3. Console Output

We will improve our console output by creating a more advanced console driver. This driver will support:

*   **Scrolling:** When the screen is full, the console will automatically scroll up to make room for new text.
*   **Cursor management:** We will be able to move the cursor to any position on the screen.
*   **Color support:** We will be able to print text in different colors.

By the end of this chapter, our operating system will be able to interact with the user through the keyboard and display formatted output on the console. We will also have a powerful debugging tool in the form of the serial port.
